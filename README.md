Here are the things I've learned so far

The basics of GIT. Still not on the "I know it already" phase, like I'm 10-15% of knowing it,
but hopefully I'll be there.

HTML. I already know it, have the idea already before joining this TOP. So some of the
lessons I just skimp.

I really appreciate my time being here. Thank you so much for everyone making this project.
